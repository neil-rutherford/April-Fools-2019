Harmless, cursor-based shenanigans you can use to prank your friends.

- mouse_fucker moves the victim's cursor to random places on the screen. The timing of the mouse shifts is random. (Requires pyautogui.)

- devils_snare defines a box that the cursor cannot move outside of. The box becomes smaller as the mouse is moved, and it becomes larger when the mouse is still. It needs a bit of work, but it's still pretty infuriating as is. (Requires pyautogui.)

- gagarin waits for 1961 seconds, then starts orbiting the victim's cursor around its old position. (Requires pyautogui and numpy.)
