Harmless, cursor-based shenanigans you can use to prank your friends.

- mouse_fucker moves the victim's cursor to a random place on the screen. The timing of the mouse shifts is random.

- devils_snare defines a box that the cursor cannot move outside of. The box becomes smaller as the mouse is moved, and it becomes larger when the mouse is still. It needs a bit of work, but it's still pretty infuriating as is.

- gagarin waits for 1961 seconds, then starts orbiting the victim's cursor around its old position.
